* zfullfs
Tiny FUSE filesystem that reports the total size & allocation of a ZFS pool.
Useful for providing data to disk status widgets that don't understand ZFS.

Usage: =zfullfs <pool> <mountpoint>=

#+begin_src shell
  $ zfullfs rpool /full
  # runs in foreground, switch to different terminal...

  $ df -h /full
  Filesystem  Size   Used  Avail Use% Mounted on
  zfullfs     928G   106G   823G  12% /full
  # df always rounds up, therefore size is slightly too big

  $ zpool list -o name,size,alloc,free rpool
  NAME        SIZE  ALLOC   FREE
  rpool       928G   105G   823G
#+end_src
